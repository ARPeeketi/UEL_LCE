# UEL_LCE


Leveraging the capabilities of the commercially available software ABAQUS, which offers an interface for implementing nonlinear finite elements known as the User Element (UEL) subroutine, we have developed our own indigenous UEL subroutine for finite element modelling. This interface empowers users to define elements of arbitrary complexity, facilitating the incorporation of intricate material behaviours into simulations.
